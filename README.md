# Arabic number to Roman Number converter TDD kata

## Task
Write a program, that converts an Arabic number to a Roman number. You can expect inputs between 1 and 9999 inclusive.

## TDD rules
- Red: Always start with a test, that will fail
- Green: Always write as little production code, that satisfies the test
- Refactor: Always try to simplify, generatlize, make the code nicer to read

## Purpose
If you do it right you will see
 - that your code is already modularized, easy to be used, tested, and easily rewrittable - not rigid
 - the algorithm emerges during those iterative steps
 - always refactored - good enough code

# Final step
When you are done, delete it and start it over. Yes, yes do it.
The way is the aim, not the end result. The aim is of the task is the points under the "Purpose" goes into your blood.
